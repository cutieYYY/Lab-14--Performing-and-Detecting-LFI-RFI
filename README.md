# Lab-14--Performing-and-Detecting-LFI-RFI

Lab Overview
In this lab, I performed Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks and investigated the results. This hands-on experience aimed to enhance my skills as a cybersecurity analyst at Structureality Inc., focusing on discovering vulnerabilities within our internal network.

Scenario
I executed LFI and RFI attacks against the public-facing website of Structureality Inc., which is hosted on a screened subnet. The purpose of this lab was to identify weaknesses in the web application that could be exploited through file inclusion vulnerabilities. After executing the attacks, I analyzed the website logs to gather evidence and Indications of Compromise (IoCs) related to LFI/RFI exploitation.

Environment Setup
Virtual Machines
KALI: This virtual machine ran Kali Linux, which I used to perform the attacks.
LAMP: This virtual machine hosted Ubuntu Server and the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) site, which I targeted for the exploitation.
Objectives
This lab was designed to test my understanding and ability to apply content examples in the following CompTIA CySA+ objectives:

System and Network Architecture:

1.1 Explained the importance of system and network architecture concepts in security operations.
Malicious Activity Indicators:

1.2 Analyzed indicators of potentially malicious activity based on the scenarios presented.
Tools and Techniques:

1.3 Used appropriate tools and techniques to identify and determine malicious activity.
Threat Intelligence vs. Threat Hunting:

1.4 Compared and contrasted the concepts of threat intelligence and threat hunting.
Mitigation Controls:

2.4 Recommended controls to mitigate attacks and software vulnerabilities after the analysis.
Incident Response:

3.2 Performed incident response activities to address the identified vulnerabilities.
Attack Methodology Frameworks:

3.5 Explained concepts related to attack methodology frameworks in the context of LFI and RFI attacks.
What I Learned
Understanding LFI and RFI Vulnerabilities:

I learned how file inclusion vulnerabilities can be exploited, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive files or remote code execution.
Practical Application of Theory:

This lab provided practical experience in identifying and exploiting LFI and RFI vulnerabilities, reinforcing my theoretical knowledge.
Log Analysis:

I developed skills in analyzing web server logs to identify signs of exploitation and trace the actions taken during the attacks.
Mitigation Strategies:

I gained insight into effective strategies for mitigating file inclusion vulnerabilities, including proper input validation and secure file handling.
Incident Response:

The lab enhanced my ability to perform incident response activities by applying the knowledge gained to real-world scenarios.
Conclusion
This lab significantly contributed to my understanding of LFI and RFI vulnerabilities, their implications for web applications, and the importance of robust security measures. The experience gained will aid me in my role as a cybersecurity analyst, enabling me to better protect Structureality Inc.'s internal network from potential threats.
